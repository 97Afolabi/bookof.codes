After a very long time, i finally overcame my laziness and built this blog. The goal is not to be the best developer blog out there. I just want somewhere i can write about the cool things i learn because i believe "If i teach it, i'll learn it".
So cheers to me.ðŸ¥‚

#### Heres an example:

```js
import { hello } from 'mymodule';

function hello() {
  console.log('why me');
}
```

Take a look at line 3
